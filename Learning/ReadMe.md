# Learning Focus & Objectives - Deep Learning

## 1. Motivation and Preliminary Focus

It is important to focus on understanding and conceptual pieces that will enable core of ML and DL.

- Fundamentals around Applied Math and ML fundamentals / Math for Deep Learning
  - Linear Algebra : Geometry, Linear Algebra, Eigen decompositions, Single Variable Calculus, Multi Variable Calculus, Integral Calculus, Random Variables
  - Probability and Statistics
  - Numerical Computations
  - ML Fundamentals

It is also important to get an exposure on tools for usage and how they function, so that we are familiar.

- Tools for Deep Learning
  - Jupyter and other IDEs
  - Using AWS Sagemaker, AWS EC2 instances, Google Colab etc
  - Selecting Servers and GPUs

- Linear Neural Networks
- Multilayer Perceptrons

**Disclaimer - These are obviously non-exhaustive list and are some suggestions. Objective is to have an idea and use some of these based on personal need and understand math behind ML and DL and work through the details. Specialization and focus in one or two methods help when we are starting the journey. Then, based on our progress, exposure to problem solving, use cases where DL is used, we can build the momentum.**
